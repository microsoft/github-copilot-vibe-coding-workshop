![GitHub Copilot - Ghiblifiled](./images/ghcp.jpg)

Let's vibe-code with [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot) and its newest and greatest features in various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java and .NET, as well as make the apps cloud-native by containerization. Are you ready to jump in?

## Background

Contoso is a company that sells products for various outdoor activities. A marketing department of Contoso would like to launch a micro social media website to promote their products for existing and potential customers. As their first MVP, the want to quickly build the website. The IT department of Contoso currently has two developers using Python and JavaScript respectively. The launch date is fast approaching, so both developers should quickly deliver the application.

But here's the situation...

## Workshop Objectives

- Build applications using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.
- Add custom instruction to GitHub Copilot so that you have more control over GitHub Copilot.
- Add various MCP servers to GitHub Copilot so that you build the applications more precisely.
